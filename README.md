# k-means-clusters-scratch

For this code, we are implementing the k-means clustering algorithm on a set of
data containing 400 examples of renormalized gene expressions. In order to show the
algorithmâ€™s properties, we will run it with different values for k clusters. We will also
run it multiple times with different randomized seedings at the beginning. In order to
see our results, we will compute the SSE of each K value for the clusters and determine
the best value k for the given data.
